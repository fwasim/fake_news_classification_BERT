Trying to classify hyperpartisan/fake news from a labelled dataset of such using the BERT model

## Running the code
1. Open the code in google colab. 
2. Connect to your local runtime as per the instructions found [here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html). Running it on the hosted runtime causes out of memory issues. 
3. Download the file `text.test.tsv` and save it in your working directory. (Alternatively, you can read the file directly from github, but in that case you will need to make slight changes to the notebook)
4. Run the code from google colab.
